Who we are

Established in 1975, LGBT Foundation exists to support the needs of the diverse range of people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans. We believe in a fair and equal society where all LGBT people can achieve their full potential. #EqualityWins underpins much of what we do and we aim to be; ‘here if you need us.’

We are a nationally significant charity firmly rooted in our local communities of Greater Manchester and provide a wide range of evidence-based and cost effective services.

Each year, we serve over 40,000 people, achieving an average 98% satisfaction rating, as well as providing information to over 200,000 individuals online. As a result, we serve more LGBT people than any other charity of our kind in the UK.

Throughout all of our work, we support LGBT people to increase their skills, knowledge and self-confidence to improve and maintain their health and wellbeing. We also work in partnership with others to build strong, cohesive and influential LGBT communities.

Working together, we are changing LGBT lives for the better and securing a safe, equal and healthy future for all LGBT people.
